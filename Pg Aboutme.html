                            Hello, my name is Eric Fernando Orospe Estrada. I'm an industrial and
                            graphic designer with a deep passion for 3D modeling. I enjoy creating
                            a variety of 3D models and bringing them to life through 3D printing.
                            Additionally, I have a keen interest in corporate identity design,
                            having worked with three brands on both original creations and
                            redesigns. I graduated from the Anáhuac University of Querétaro, and I
                            find fulfillment in helping others, utilizing design and 3D modeling
                            as my primary tools.
